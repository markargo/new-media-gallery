    desc: "<p><em>Tabletop Minigolf</em> is an invitation to connect, play, and rediscover the simple pleasure of a shared game.</p> <p>Two players face off, each using a putter and a ball to navigate a dynamic course filled with moving obstacles. These shifting elements are all powered by technology and code connected to an Arduino UNO device. The goal is simple: complete the course with fewer hits than your partner.</p> <p>Inspired by gaming experiences that offer breaks from the everyday, I set out to create an experience that momentarily draws people out of their routines, sparking spontaneous engagement and connection with fellow participants.</p> <p>What sets <em>Tabletop Minigolf</em> apart is the emphasis on movement and unpredictability. A portion of the course is decorated with traps and decisions the player must make to proceed. Unlike most traditional tabletop games, this experience incorporates dynamic shifting technological elements that require players to think critically and adjust real-time strategies.</p> <p>But It’s more than just the game itself; it’s about the shared experience between two players. In an era where digital interactions often replace face-to-face engagement, this project is a reminder of the joy found in real-world play. Whether competing against a friend or a stranger, <em>Tabletop Minigolf</em> invites players to let down their guard, share a moment of friendly competition, and step away from the demands of daily life if only for a moment.</p>",

A series of flowers and plants are planted in this space, while open areas are purposely left for people to freely walk through and interact with these flowers. As you approach the flowers, they bloom and fade, dynamically presenting the fluidity of life.</p> <p>This piece is inspired by my favorite song, Fallin’ Flower by SEVENTEEN. When I listen to this song, a vivid image comes to mind: flowers blooming and falling in the wind, moments of life that are both transient and profound. It is these emotions and imagery that this piece translates into a palpable, immersive form that attempts to give the viewer a sense of the passage of time and the meaning of life in the garden.</p> <p>“刹那に生きてたど君と会い<br /> <em>Only living in a moment, I met because of you;</em><br /> そう全てにわ意味があることを知ったんだ<br /> <em>Only then can I understand that everything has meaning.</em>”</p> <p>Everyone can be a flower, but the meaning of life should not stop at the moment of blooming. The fading of a flower is also an integral part of life. Falling petals symbolize the end, but they also nurture new beginnings. Just like the endless cycle of nature, every moment of your existence has its unique value.</p> <p>I hope this garden will provide a space for the audience to reflect on life. Here, they can stop and feel the fragility and strength of the flowers while revisiting those fleeting but profound moments in their own lives. When they leave this space, they can take away a sense of solace - that even the most insignificant moments hold deep meaning.</p>",

The true nature of a community comes out when there is a necessity for everyone to overcome fear and tragedy as one, and people help their neighbors as well as strangers.<br /> A sense of togetherness grows inside of helpful interactions, leaving trust and connection between people in the places it has been, something that has been somewhat lost in our current age. There is beauty in selflessness and duty which is not as integrated into our daily lives as it once was.<br /> The works draw from my home communities in the East Coast, especially boating and seaside communities. Folk tales and songs have been passed down telling of experiences, jokes, and cautionary tales, manifesting usually in largely seabound motifs. Hopefully communities like those who were unified by their harbour, the sea and their shared experience will remember their connection to each other and (like the Mary Ellen Carter), rise again.</p> <p>In viewing this piece, I hope you may have a chance to reflect upon those in your communities, and those in communities that have come before you.</p>",

It asks for reverence: to see without touching, to appreciate without diminishing.

    desc: "<p>Crochet has long existed as a form of generative art—an intricate practice of creating patterns through repetition, structure, and intentionality. Long before the advent of computers and technology, crochet symbolized the human ability to generate complexity from simple loops and stitches. In my work, I explore the bridge between this ancient craft and modern generative art, blending the analog and digital worlds in a deeply personal way.</p> <p>Using p5.js, I first design my crochet patterns through code, translating mathematical computations into visual expressions. These digital designs, born out of algorithms and generative principles are then transformed into tangible, hand-crocheted pieces. This process is a unique dialogue between two worlds—the precision of code and the tactile intimacy of handcraft—culminating in a product of code that can be touched, held, and felt.</p> <p>For me, crochet is more than a craft; it is a thread that connects me to my roots and my mother, who remains thousands of miles away. Growing up, my mother’s hands were always busy—cooking, sewing, creating—infusing love and care into every small detail. Now, as I crochet, I feel her presence in every stitch, as though the act itself is a quiet conversation between us. The generative nature of crochet mirrors the generative art I code, and each project is a reflection of this duality—a blend of tradition and innovation, the past and the future.</p> <p>The bridge between crochet and generative art is both profound and unique. By coding first, I can visualize patterns that take shape mathematically, and by crocheting them, I transform intangible code into something physical and real. The process of turning digital logic into a tangible artifact embodies the fusion of art and technology, grounding abstract concepts in the warmth of human touch.</p> <p>Through this work, I honor the timeless art of crochet while embracing the possibilities of generative design. It is a celebration of connection—to family, to culture, and to the endless interplay between the digital and the handmade. Each piece is not just a physical object but a testament to the enduring and evolving nature of creativity.</p>",

Walking past the hall filled with a variety of paintings, I suddenly noticed a spotlight shining on a group of canvases. When I approached it, butterflies were stirring their wings on the paintings! I thought I was seeing an illusion. I was so scared that I fell backwards onto the floor. When I looked up at them again, they were still. I shook my head in disbelief and stared at them - they were actual butterfly specimens. Weren’t they just moving a second ago?</em></p> <p><em>Frozen Time</em> is a unique artwork that integrates traditional painting techniques with technology. Created with acrylic paint, pearlescent watercolour, shrinking plastic sheets, clear acrylic, and Arduino components, these materials come together to bring butterfly specimens to life. When the room is empty, the butterflies sit perfectly still, as if trapped in a moment of frozen time. Once someone steps closer, their wings begin to stir, as if waking from a long slumber. This idea emerged from my experience of frequently drawing still objects on canvas. As I was working on the project, I began to wonder—what if these objects could break free from the flat surface, transforming from 2D to 3D, and then from 3D into something alive? At that moment, they wouldn’t just exist as images but would form a tangible connection with our world.</p> <p>Working on this project has been challenging and fascinating. I wanted to merge my passion for painting with the interactive techniques I’ve learned in recent years to create an experience that feels both surprising and meaningful for the audience. For this, the concept of <em>Frozen Time</em> was born.</p>",

Its rhythm is undisturbed, ignoring everything around it as it continues its wave—steady, focused, and unaltered.</p> <p>Since childhood, I have been drawn to these figures. I remember watching them wave endlessly at everyone and everything tirelessly. In my culture, their movements are not seen as meaningless. Their wave attracts and brings fortune and prosperity. However, to me, as a child, all I see are some cute but boring objects I am forbidden to play with. I can’t help wondering if I could disrupt them by placing objects in their way. So, I secretly tried many times, but their movement continued, uninterrupted and undisturbed. The rhythm remained unbroken.</p> <p>My work presents this childhood curiosity and invites viewers to explore and engage with the unique charm of the Lucky Cat. Just like when I was a child, I still try to disturb these figures who are forever focused only on themselves. I place various objects under their waving arms and assign them different tasks. Now, from our perspective, they seem to take on new roles — some now pound mochi, others beat drums, and some make prints. However, these lucky cats are still performing the same motion continuously. For them, is there really a difference between being seen as a symbol of fortune and a worker who pounds mochi?</p> <p>Their core never changes. Just as regardless of changes in their colours or materials, their essence remains unchanged—they are still perceived as Lucky Cats. Despite my attempts to interrupt, they maintain their consistency and rhythm, unconsciously offering a moment of stillness and peace.</p>",

    desc: "<p><em>Lebanon’s Memory</em> is a collection of images and artefacts that surround the essence of Lebanon during war and post-restoration. A country with rich history and beautiful nature yet she holds so much hurt due to her enemies’ harm and greed. The combination of double layering; a plastic cover externally and a canvas cloth internally foreshadows how true beauty is protected from the horrors of war. The exterior reflects a familiar, almost clichéd image of a war-ravaged landscape—one that the Western gaze often reduces the Middle East to, overlooking the depth and resilience that lie beyond the ruins. The interior canvas is being protected by plastic displaying that true beauty exists outside of these falsified stereotypes. Dalia’s composition is on a moving hanger, symbolising the ongoing restoration cycle that Lebanon has endured due to decades of on-and-off oppressive destruction. These wheels will always complete their cycle in motion no matter what they roll through, similar to how Lebanon always rises from the ashes like the Phoenix, a symbol of resistance. Amid the country’s economic collapse, balconies become makeshift laundries, where clothes hang to dry—washed clean, yet still stained by the corruption that lingers in the air, much like the dirty money that flows unseen through the cracks of the government. Rooted in cultural significance, Dalia Chami’s artistic journey is deeply<br /> intertwined with Lebanon—the land of her ancestors, the home where her family remains. Her work is a reflection of this connection, shaped by the resilience woven into its streets and stories. Seeking to understand the unyielding spirit of her people, she turned to her mother, who had lived through the civil war, and asked: “What keeps Lebanon going?”</p> <p><em>Growing up in Lebanon during the war, you adapt without realizing it. To outsiders, it</em><br /> <em>looks like resilience, but for us, it becomes second nature—an unspoken survival</em><br /> <em>instinct. We find ways around every obstacle, from power cuts to water shortages. Over</em><br /> <em>time, it backfires; we’re almost addicted to the adrenaline of crisis. But we don’t give</em><br /> <em>in—we trust in God and always find a way forward. (Chami, 2025).</em></p>",

Later, I went to Latvia for middle school and was exposed to a completely different culture. When I reached high school, I came to Canada to live and study. The cultures and educational styles of these countries are vastly different. These experiences made me realize that there is no fixed look for art at all. Everyone’s background, experiences and upbringing affects their understanding of art. I think that’s the beauty of art. I have always enjoyed art and had the chance to experience different ways of learning. I have found that the understanding of art is different in every country, every age stage and even every race. Therefore, I don’t think we should set a uniform standard for art. Instead of teaching children “what is art”, we should teach them how to create with their own hands and let them discover the meaning of art by themselves.</p> <p>My work is an interactive miniature world, which is an interactive project that I realized with children of different ages. In this work, we started from planting mushrooms and observing their whole process from spores to maturity; we also used materials such as Arduino, 360-degree servo motors, LED lights, etc., to create small devices that can light up, rotate and interact. The children not only learned about science through hands-on manipulation, but also incorporated their creativity into their works. In addition, I randomly interviewed the participating children so that they could share their thoughts, ideas and experiences. These authentic voices also became part of the work.</p> <p>What makes this work unique is its ability to include everyone. Regardless of a child’s background, personality, abilities, or challenges—whether they are introverted or extroverted, neurodivergent, or living with a physical disability—this work is designed to welcome and include everyone. My hope is that every child will be able to participate and find their own way of expressing themselves. This project offers a chance to get creative, explore, and learn together in a relaxed and enjoyable way. I also hope that this work will provide an opportunity for parents to create and communicate with their children, making art a part of family interaction.</p>",

The game invites players to enter an empty home and go through moments in time as they walk through memories inside a Chinese household. Inspired by the bittersweet longing of saudade, players explore the changing environment as they find themselves in a loop, moving forward to uncover more of the untold story. Throughout the journey of the game, it guides the player to come to their own conclusion about the narrative, forcing them to discover the story within the environment on their own. Mimicking scenarios in real life, the subtleties in the environment are purposely vague, much like how Asian parental love will never be explicitly said or shown.

Cracked clay, rolling dunes, and towering rock formations stretch beneath a relentless sun. But when night falls, the landscape transforms. Bioluminescent flora awaken, casting an ethereal glow across the terrain, while strange, otherworldly creatures emerge from their hiding places. Life here is cyclical, adapting to the shifting balance of light and darkness, growth and<br /> dormancy.</p> <p>In this exploratory adventure, you are both an observer and a participant in this ecosystem. With each passing cycle, new plants unfurl their delicate petals, hidden pathways reveal themselves, and creatures move in patterns dictated by the world around them. Your task is to document and collect these living wonders, piecing together their intricate relationships. Some plants bloom only when touched by moonlight, others hide beneath the sand, waiting for the cruel heat of the sun to emerge. Creatures form unique symbiotic bonds, surviving in ways that challenge your understanding of life in this post-apocalyptic world.</p> <p>With every discovery, you unlock deeper insights into the resilience of nature. What will you find hidden in the ruins of the past? What secrets do the glowing spores, the whispering winds, and the shifting sands hold? Each cycle brings new opportunities to explore, document, and uncover the patterns that shape this ecosystem.</p> <p>This game is not just about survival, it is about connection. The world does not fight against you, it invites you to understand it. Whether you follow the soft glow of a bioluminescent trail, track the nocturnal migrations of a species, or simply watch as the land breathes and shifts, the environment tells a story, one that is waiting for you to uncover.</p>",

    desc: "<p>My work, <em>Rewind: The New Media Experience</em>, invites viewers to explore the intersection of memory, interaction, and creative expression. This interactive digital installation utilizes hand gesture recognition technology to transform the act of movement into the creation of dynamic collages. By drawing images from curated archives and overlaying them with flickering texts that evoke playfulness and depth, the project serves as both a reflection on nostalgia and a celebration of the media’s transformative power. The concept stems from a desire to heal through play and explore how seemingly fragmented pieces—whether they be images, text, or memories—can coalesce into something meaningful. The randomization of image sizes, rotations, and opacities reflects the unpredictability of recollection, while the presence of textual elements invites a dialogue about media as an extension of the body and mind. Technologically, the piece combines motion detection with traditional digital drawing tools, bridging tactile interaction with the virtual realm. Users can modify the canvas dynamically, reshaping their experience and understanding of the artwork. The project is not merely about creating visual outputs but about fostering a participatory environment where viewers become collaborators in reimagining memory and media. Ultimately, <em>Rewind</em> emphasizes empathy and inclusivity by offering a space where participants can explore their unique creative expressions. It is a both nostalgic journey and forward-looking meditation on how the media continues to shape our identities and shared narratives.</p>",

In the grand scheme of it all, I believe we humans are constantly in this transitional stage as the world around us continues to grow and evolve, we are forever transitioning from one medium to another. If that is the case, who’s to say these “old” mediums are truly outdated. I like to imagine telling the pioneers that one day a glowing box capable of harnessing electricity and colour to project images of the future would be outdated. I’ve come to enjoy the warmth of using “old” mediums which evoke certain feelings and emotions, like dusting off an old book or relighting the fading flame of a candle.<br /> The videos presented have all been created or filmed by myself, in various locations across Southern Ontario, the place I was born and raised. The place where these transitional memories of mine are the strongest. Old schools, homes, areas I used to play are all captured in time on these fragile little tapes, tapes which will eventually wear and fade with time as all things eventually will.

I wanted to capture that feeling in a way that lets the audience step into the experience themselves and feel the weight of those moments.</p> <p>The story follows a man stuck in a cycle, waking up every day to the same routine. Through video clips embedded in the game, players get a sense of his world—his blank expressions, the muted tones of his surroundings, and the heaviness of his choices (or lack thereof). By layering text over the videos, I tried to bring the character’s inner thoughts to life, giving players a glimpse into his headspace while still leaving room for their own interpretations.</p> <p>This project combines my love for film and interactive storytelling. I’ve always been drawn to projects that blur the line between mediums, and Twine felt like the perfect tool to experiment with blending video and player-driven narrative. The choices in the game are subtle, reflecting the small decisions we make in real life that might not change the bigger picture but still feel significant at the moment.</p> <p>Ultimately, this piece feels personal because it reflects something I think about a lot: how much of our lives are shaped by routines, and how much agency we really have to break out of them. It’s about finding meaning—or at least noticing the details—in a world that can sometimes feel monotonous.

    desc: "<p><em>Downfall of the Cheezboyz</em> is a mockumentary telling the tale of the short-lived but impactful existence of a queer punk band formed in the heart of Toronto in 2022. The Cheezboyz were a group of weird, genderfluid, theatre-kid-turned-punk musicians whose passion for making art brought them together. The band’s songs were sometimes about situationships, polyamory, and growing up in a bubble, and more often than not, these songs were loud, messy, inspired by musical theatre dramatics, and deeply personal, much like the members themselves.</p> <p>The documentary captures the spirit of the band during their brief but explosive era. Through humor, music, and a touch of chaos, the film offers audiences a glimpse into the lives of young queer adults navigating university, relationships, and identity in a cooperative house turned DIY music venue. From the founding of the band (inspired by heartbreak and the creative pain relief that songwriting is) to their sudden disappearance, <em>Downfall of the Cheezboyz</em> invites viewers to laugh, reflect, and *just maybe* feel a little more connected to the universality of making art and finding a community. Whether or not you like the music, I hope the story makes you smile.</p>",

A memory only exists by its very conjuring and subsequent repeated recall - it is maintained by how it activates the body. To remain well-conserved, artifacts also require consistent methods of care which prevent it from deterioration: light, temperature, humidity or even dissociation, which spurns the loss of information over time. Objects losing context affect their meaning, which affect how they are kept, maintained or even loved.</p> <p>At the forefront of this piece are found secondhand objects, keepsakes once loved and cherished but no longer kept, neatly presented in a fashion familiar to homely ways we keep items of significance. When someone picks up an object, a computer attempts to fill the space of original memories left, invoking interpretations while participants do so humanly - both are finding a way to absorb what is on its way to being gone. These manufactured memories begin to flood back, but upon being accessed they change, fracture, degrade.</p> <p>Whether truthful or accurate or completely false, users become personally addressed to preserve an object’s importance by either conjuring a false memory or finding a true one from lived experience embedded within themselves. Doing this act attempts to preserve the significance and memories of objects, yet changes them. Each time a memory is applied, it is altered: perhaps more meaningful but less objective. The piece hopes to reflect: How does an object become different when we actively have a moment with it? What do we do with all we know, even as what we know changes? Is it an impossible task for a memory to remain preserved across time or circumstance?</p>",

My animations endeavor to transport the viewer out of the world they live in and into a different one, which I’ve always believed is the core of what makes entertainment so compelling. The ability to move your viewer out of reality through the movement of pixels on a screen is not unique to animation, but it should be impossible with animation. How is it that we can see designs which don’t fit into our perception of the world but still be able to form a connection to the work? Why have cartoons resonated with generations of people? The answer is nuanced, and speaks volumes for animation as a medium of expression.</p> <p>The answer, I believe, is intention. In animation, nothing happens by accident; there are no improved lines, no unexpected bursts of wind, no camera constraints. Anything is possible with the proper skill and creativity. Animation is the illusion of life, and therefore an intuitive understanding of life is needed in order to expand on it through the hand of the artist. Once this is understood, an intention is chosen, and that intention can be seen throughout all the choices made in a piece of animated media.</p> <p>The intention behind my work is to tap into the depths of the imagination, giving life to the childlike wonder we hide within ourselves as a consequence of getting older.

    desc: "<p><em>Escapism</em> is a playful interactive virtual environment that uses 2D art and randomised pathways to transport audiences to peaceful, faraway places. The experience invites users to focus on the present, let go of the things in their lives that are causing distress, and immerse themselves in an alternate reality. Ultimately, it is an experience that aims to help others enjoy the moment and distance themselves from a chaotic reality.</p> <p>This work mainly appeals to art enthusiasts and those who enjoy searching for deeper meaning in ambiguous situations. The whimsical—and somewhat mysterious—visuals and amusingly enigmatic phrases displayed throughout the experience blend elements from poetry and picture books to evoke a child-like sense of wonder and play. Each scene presents audiences with new imagery and different phrases to interpret. In addition, the buttons that take users from scene to scene are randomly placed. This feature encourages users to take their time within the virtual space and interpret what they see on screen before continuing to the next scene.</p> <p>My work often explores themes of escapism and finding joy in the little details. <em>Escapism</em> is an extension of that exploration, responding to feelings related to distress and being overwhelmed. This work also explores traditional art in the digital realm and creativity as a tool for “escaping” reality to achieve a state of calm.</p>",

It is a land where villagers and animals thrive in<br /> peaceful coexistence, nurtured by generations who honored its spirit. But peace is fragile.<br /> When outsiders discover this untouched haven, their desire to claim and exploit the land<br /> disrupts the balance that has endured for centuries. As the land’s protector, you step into<br /> the role of defender, guided by ancestral wisdom and a profound connection to nature.<br /> Your mission is clear: preserve the sanctuary and its inhabitants while repelling those who<br /> seek to dismantle its harmony.</p> <p><em>The Journey</em> is a third-person game that immerses players in the tension<br /> between preservation and invasion. Through vivid landscapes, from windswept dunes to<br /> serene temple grounds, the game explores the emotional weight of safeguarding a<br /> cherished home. Players will encounter moments of action, strategy, and reflection, each<br /> choice shaping the future of the land and its story.</p> <p>This project draws inspiration from the delicate relationship between humanity<br /> and the natural world, as well as the enduring power of cultural heritage. <em>The Journey</em> is more than a battle for survival; it is a journey of resilience, hope, and reverence. It challenges players to reflect on the costs of progress and the importance of protecting the spaces and stories that define us. By stepping into this narrative, players become more than observers—they become part of the sanctuary’s legacy, fighting not just for a place, but for a way of life worth preserving.</p>",

    desc: "<p><em>The Disabling</em> focuses on a series of physical resin exoskeletons that severely limit the movement of my jaw and tongue. My tongue and jaw are the site of my disability therefore the mouthpieces add another layer of disability. My speech becomes more slurred, I drool more frequently. These exoskeletons become a symbol of enhancing and flaunting disability. Through this flaunting of my disability, I can control how I interact with the world, an affordance that is rarely granted to disabled people. Through systematic practices and individual beliefs against disability, disabled people are seen as non-human. With The Disabling, I offer disabled people a choice in how they want to present themselves and challenge the notions working against them. I found power, joy, filth, and community through my disability, why shouldn’t I flaunt them?</p> <p>The self-portraits explore the intersection of disability and sexuality, two qualities that are rarely shown together. That is disabled people are often showcased in two ways: feeble sexless objects, or hyper-sexual deviants where sex is distorted into a threat, and these forms strip the sexual expression of disabled people. These forms further the ableist notion that disabled people are non-human and are not worthy of sexual freedom. The self-portraits portray the mouthpieces in a sensual way, the next hottest kink item. Disability becomes tangled with sexuality, and people are unable to separate the two entities.</p> <p>The presentation of <em>The Disabling</em> is based on natural history/science museums, which are sites of biological differences, and mirror the history of presenting disabled people in freakshows. People are allowed to gawk and laugh at how different those people are within the format’s safety. The Disabling follows a similar format, but the confrontal subject matter forces people to look at how they see disability. The boundary between the gawker and participant dissolves and the viewer becomes aware of their actions.</p> <p>The Interview is inspired by the trashy talk show interviews and the inherent power dynamic between the hosts and guests. The video, based on awkward situations where I have been made out to be “too disabled” to talk to, satirely approaches the themes of technoableism, power dynamics, and social interactions between disabled and non-disabled people. I had people approach me and try to strike up conversations with me but once I opened up my mouth and spoke, their whole mannerisms changed. I had people say “Oh” and leave the physical space, I had people attempt signing at me, and awkwardly try to pivot away. These situations always left me in the awkward space of maneuvering from human to non-human. The Interview is a reenactment of those situations but I am not pushed into the position of making myself smaller, the host, representing those people, is made out to be the fool.</p>",

The lightsaber hilt features a dull gray and gold look, splattered with pink and blue paint, influenced by her pistol. The blade glows bright pink to match her iconic pink eyes, which is caused by using shimmer to save her life.<br /> As the lightsaber turns on, it plays its infamous hum. Moreover, when in contact, the saber flickers white and plays a slashing sound like a regular lightsaber would. This project combines my interests in Star Wars and Arcane, creating a fusion that has not been seen before. Just like the fusion that is used to ignite Jinx’s pistol.</p>",

Inspired by the concept of sensory<br /> deprivation, this piece enhances the listener’s focus on sound, amplifying its emotional<br /> depth and transformative power. By modulating reverb, delay, and panning, I create a<br /> dynamic auditory environment in which the perception of space shifts—at times<br /> expansive and open, at others confined and intimate.</p> <p>This project began as an exploration of sensory deprivation, originally incorporating a<br /> soundproof booth to immerse participants in total darkness and heighten their<br /> awareness of sound. As the work evolved, I shifted away from the physical confines of<br /> the booth to focus entirely on the transformative qualities of sound itself. This change<br /> allowed me to explore the emotional and spatial dimensions of sound more freely,<br /> creating an experience where participants feel immersed in ever-changing sonic<br /> spaces.</p> <p>In a world dominated by visuals, sound often takes a backseat despite its immense<br /> capacity to evoke emotion and alter perception. <em>Sonic Resonance</em> challenges this<br /> imbalance by removing visual elements, immersing listeners in a sonic journey that<br /> evolves over time. The soundscape blends ambient compositions across multiple<br /> genres, each designed to evoke a range of emotional states. By carefully manipulating<br /> space and effects, the work encourages participants to not only listen but to feel the<br /> changing sonic environment, imagining its physical and emotional contours.</p>",

More than just a place to discover and log live music events, it reimagines how we connect to concerts through collective storytelling.</p> <p>The concept stems from my personal connection to live music, specifically the rush of adrenaline I feel at every concert and how quickly it fades away. I wanted to hold onto that feeling just a little longer. A concert is more than just music; it’s a mix of sounds, lights, energy, and shared moments. Everyone has a favourite concert memory shaped by these external elements that make it special. <em>Reverbe</em> captures these elements, creating a space where users can log and review their experiences, discover new concerts, view real-time updates, and connect with like-minded fans. It’s about savouring the moment, rather than simply preserving it.</p> <p><em>Reverbe</em> is built on the idea of community storytelling, where each user’s post offers a chance to relive the concert from a different perspective, deepening the connection between fans and live music. This installation brings that concept to life. Presented as a mock product launch, it simulates how Reverbe’s key feature—concert reviewing—would function in the real app. Audience members can write a concert review by scanning the QR code and see it instantly appear on the live feed, collectively building an archive of memories. As the feed cycles through submissions, it highlights the heart of Reverbe—the power of perspective, the joy of reminiscing, and the way live music brings people together.</p>",

I believe that an underrated and sometimes overlooked form of art is sheet music, which is something I have always admired for both its utility and visual appearance. Musical theory has many rules but also allows so much room for creativity and experimentation. Another thing I love about sheet music is that it is a convenient way to share compositions with other people to learn to play themselves, as opposed to trying to learn how to play something by ear.</p> <p>My project showcases a collection of original musical compositions that have different themes and venture into several genres of music, such as jazz and classical. The sheet music for each piece is displayed along with a chance to hear a recording of each one via a pair of headphones. The papers are decorated in ways that suit the respective themes, such as using colours and icons to spark the listener’s imagination. This is meant to communicate a sense of wonder and demonstrate the way a person playing an instrument can feel when taking the notes off the page and bringing them to life.</p> <p>The target audience for this project is people who can read sheet music or play an instrument. However, it can also be enjoyed by those who simply like instrumental music, perhaps fans of piano music or those who take interest in the soundtracks of films or video games.</p>",

I would throw up every year on the first day of school and my parents insisted I was “just shy”, but I knew it was more than that. When I was 15, I was officially diagnosed with social and generalized anxiety disorder. I’m 22 now and have come to realize how differently my brain works from others. I was curious to see if I could show what it feels like to live a day in my body. And thus, <em>This Too Shall Pass</em> was born.</p> <p>This visual novel gives a taste of how it feels when anxiety is at its worst, such as during a panic attack or a harmful hyperfixation. Conversely, it shows how to calm down from an anxiety attack by teaching relaxation skills that help soothe one’s mind from the spiral of thoughts and worry. As you play through the story, anxiety attacks get triggered by specific elements and situations, and your goal is to use coping mechanisms and breathing techniques to bring yourself back to a calm state.</p> <p>With an immersive experience such as this, those who don’t or couldn’t understand what social anxiety feels like will get the chance to. Players can gain more sensitivity for those who struggle with their mental health and gain tools to deal with any anxiety they might experience in their lives. Everyone experiences some anxiety, either from social situations, separation, phobias, or various other stimuli, and there isn’t enough entertaining artistic media that deal with it out there. <em>This Too Shall Pass</em> is a lighthearted way to consume tough topics and gain a better, more empathetic understanding of mental health.</p>",

    desc: "<p><em>“Your heart is already too heavy to carry any more regret in it.”</em></p> <p><em>Leave It Behind in Tatters</em> is an interactive installation exploring the self-imposed, painful burden of regret, and the physical manifestation of accepting such guilt by letting it go. The audience is invited to write a letter about a personal regret, no matter how minuscule or gut-wrenching. This letter is then fed into a machine that shreds its contents into tiny confetti-sized pieces and shoots them out towards the front-facing wall of the room. When the shredded paper comes into contact with the wall, its physical form is transformed into a digital projection of colourful particles. As more people share and destroy their letters, the more particles are generated and fill the room; illuminating the space in shared catharsis.</p> <p>The feeling of regret often comes from what we perceive as a personal failing: for making the wrong choice, for not taking action, for not living up to the moment, for not being “good enough”. The finality of these choices, thanks to the weight of time, manifests into a crushing sensation, emotionally and physically. While sometimes a fleeting experience, in others, the all-consuming feeling eats away at the psyche, creating an enduring mark of the mistake on one’s consciousness.</p> <p>This piece positions the audience to confront their own regrets in a familiar struggle of self-reflection and forgiveness. Inspired by cultural rituals of letting go of past transgressions and negative sentiments, viewers commit their thoughts to paper as a tangible expression of their regret. Through the act of writing and destruction, their pain is reconciled with and released; scattering now indecipherable words beyond our reality and transforming them into a visually beautiful and immersive display. Each person’s contribution to the environment thus forms the audience’s embodied experience–where solace can be found in shared anguish and emotional release.</p>",

    desc: "<p>If you don’t live to remember, are you really alive?</p> <p>Memories form the core of our identity, they define our experiences and shape who we become, influencing greatly in the legacy we leave behind. But what happens when memories become intrusive, distorted and corrupted from reality?</p> <p><em>A Distant Memory</em> explores the delicate divide between genuine experience and artificial perception, unfolding a narrative where truth remains elusive and reality slips further from grasp.</p> <p>Tito Cross, a respected police detective, is plagued by recurring visions of a violent uprising, memories that feel disturbingly real but cannot place as his own. Desperate for answers, he turns to psychiatrist Dr. Adler, who dismisses his experiences as stress-induced hallucinations. However, as Tito recounts his harrowing flashes of insurrection, military crackdowns, and imprisonment, it becomes clear that something far more sinister lies beneath Dr. Adler’s reassurances. His search for the truth pulls him into a tangled web of deception, memory manipulation, and conspiracy hidden behind the facade of professional care.</p> <p>Inspired by George Orwell’s <em>1984</em>, as well as psychological thrillers like <em>The Parallax View (1974)</em> and <em>Dark City (1998)</em>, this short-film explores timeless and increasingly relevant themes of control versus freedom, power dynamics, and the manipulation of reality. In an era where the line between information and misinformation has been immensely blurred out, these themes resonate more deeply than ever. Using atmospheric storytelling, evocative visuals, fragmented editing, and immersive sound design, this narrative subtly unfolds a narrative that not only immerses the audience but also reveals a cast of deeply complex characters.</p> <p><em>A Distant Memory</em> challenges the viewer to not only question the reliability of their own memories but also the motivations behind those who claim to guide their understanding of truth.</p>",

It invites anyone to explore and interact with the elements displayed on-screen, listening to multiple perspectives and facets pertaining to a much larger issue.</p> <p>This idea of telling different narratives and perspectives of these issues have stemmed from my own personal experiences and upbringing, as I myself have experienced my own struggles of fitting in with the rest of the crowd–being a queer, neurodivergent person of color. I hope that in telling a story loosely based on my own, it can resonate with many others who have gone through the same, if not similar experiences I have. Indeed, I made sure the work felt inclusive enough for anyone–not just through the narrative itself, but through the visual elements that won’t be too overbearing to people with certain sensitivities.</p>",

    desc: "<p><em>Dawn of The Arcana</em> is a deeply personal visual novel that implements the transformative themes of tarot cards and spirituality. These themes are explored not as a rigid belief system but as a fluid space for introspection, growth, and connection to the self. At its core, the game dives into themes of personal growth, self-discovery, connection, and emotional navigation, woven into a coming-of-age narrative inspired by my lived experiences. Additionally, my personal journal entries have been pivotal in shaping the world, serving as creative inspiration and bridging my experiences with the fictional characters in the story.</p> <p>The use of tarot cards reflects the protagonist’s journey, with different Major Arcana representing each stage of personal transformation and challenges throughout the story. The unique aesthetics and properties of crystals are also used to reflect the emotional landscape the player traverses, acting as symbolic anchors for each path they choose.</p> <p>I created <em>Dawn of The Arcana</em> to give form to complex feelings by blending storytelling and visual art to capture the delicate process of “becoming.” The characters’ emotional depth reflects my vulnerability, emphasizing the beauty of growth through struggle and reflection. The game’s hand-drawn art and intimate dialogue create an immersive experience where players can find pieces of their own journeys mirrored in the narrative.</p> <p>Ultimately, this project invites players to explore their inner selves. <em>Dawn of The Arcana</em> encourages mindfulness, empathy, and emotional exploration by allowing players to choose the story’s direction and outcome. It stands as a reminder that personal growth is an ongoing, nonlinear process—one where we are forever learning, shedding, and discovering who we are meant to become.</p>",

    desc: "<p>Professional sport teams are all doomed to an unrelenting cycle of triumph and defeat. Even when victory is achieved, the feeling is often fleeting and the focus quickly shifts to the future and the next challenge. Players who achieve greatness together are often dispersed, never to play together again. My project seeks to capture the essence of a perfect period in time: Manchester City’s historic 2022/23 treble-winning season.</p> <p>This immersive 3D environment aims to transcend the ephemeral nature of sports and celebrate the pinnacle of achievements in the world of professional soccer. At its core, the project is a replica of Manchester City’s locker room during the 2022/23 season made using Unreal Engine. Each player’s locker is interactive and filled with personal items. By engaging with objects around the locker room, players can unlock highlight videos showcasing iconic moments, hear the electric roar of crowd chants and explore information about each player’s contributions to the treble run. For a team to dominate, everything must align; players performing at their peak, strategy performing flawlessly and luck on their side. Manchester City’s 2022/23 treble was the result of years of near-perfect play, with the team dominating England and European competitions for nearly a decade striving to perfect their ways before finally achieving their goals. However, even the greatest dynasties face decline, the current struggles of Manchester City in 2025 remind us that no reign is eternal, and it’s these fleeting moments of perfection we must remember and immortalize.</p> <p>This project aims to capture that essence, celebrating the treble-winning season while acknowledging the inevitable passing of time. As seasons move on, the treble-winning team that dominated Europe will slowly break down — players leave, staff leave, and eventually, no one from the 2023 roster will remain. My project is a tribute to what was achieved, a way to immortalize greatness before it fades, and a reminder that nothing, no matter how perfect, lasts forever.</p>",

The transition from adolescence to adulthood seems almost impossible, the once bright possibilities of careers, relationships, and independence are just out of reach. In such times, themes like nihilism and absurdism become relatable coping mechanisms, offering comfort in their distinct honesty.</p> <p>Through contrasting visual themes, <em>NOTHING MATTERS</em> captures the emotional spectrum of these two opposing perspectives. Together, these portraits challenge you to consider how you navigate your own existential struggles, finding the balance between despair and defiance.</p>",

ADHD is often reduced to stereotypes like procrastination or inattention, but its effects are much more subtle and severe. It deeply impacts motivation - not just for activities one enjoys, but also for everyday tasks.</p> <p>Additionally, ADHD often manifests as uncontrollable small movements when trying to stay still. For those without ADHD, it can be difficult to fully understand these experiences. To bridge this gap in understanding, Silvia has designed a narrative-driven video that viewers can engage with interactive mini-scenes powered by H5P, making choices that reflect the challenges of ADHD. These scenes are rooted in Silvia’s personal experiences, illustrating struggles with focus, sensory overload, and emotional regulation. Through active participation, audiences can experience the frustrations and struggles that come with ADHD, fostering empathy and deeper understanding.</p> <p>Silvia’s project also aims to challenge the common misconceptions surrounding ADHD and promote a more accurate, compassionate view of neurodiversity. With an open-ended conclusion, the video encourages reflection and invites viewers to consider how mental health and cognitive differences are perceived in society.</p>",

Why, as someone with agoraphobia and social anxiety, would you willingly draw more attention to yourself in a sea of people who already make you feel like you don’t belong? The answer is neither simple nor singular. It is a paradox of defiance and devotion, of fear and resilience, of self-doubt and self-discovery.<br /> The hijab—commonly known as a piece of fabric worn by some Muslim women to cover their hair—is more than just a symbol. It is an intimate, deeply personal practice shaped by faith, culture, and lived experience. Yet, despite its personal and religious significance to so many, it is often misunderstood, mischaracterized, and vilified. It invites curiosity and judgment in equal measure, placing those who wear it under an unrelenting gaze, whether they want it or not.<br /> The Weight I Wear is a block printing, textile, and audio piece that chronicles my journey with the hijab—from my earliest perceptions of it to the evolving relationship I have with it today. Through layers of ink pressed into fabric, woven textures, and audio narrations, this work explores the intersection of identity, fear, and the quiet strength it takes to embrace otherness in a world that resists it.</p>",
