    desc: "<p>After eight months of continued collaboration, effort, experimentation and creativity, the New Media program at Toronto Metropolitan University is delighted to announce and share with the public METAMORPHOSIS 2025 - a collection of works from the 2024-2025 thesis cohort. METAMORPHOSIS brings together a diverse range of works, offering a glimpse into a moment of artistic and technological variability, where change is both a process and a constant.</p> <p><strong>METAMORPHOSIS</strong> arose from a period of uncertainty. As emerging artists in a tumultuous cultural and social landscape, transformation represents resilience. The ability to adapt is not just a necessity but a creative force – one that shapes both our individual practices and the broader field.</p>",
    footer: "<p>Our practices are molded by our inherent curiosity. Through constant iteration and reinvention, we embrace this fluidity as a catalyst for creation. We have combined mediums, technologies, and languages across generations, finding new ways to express ourselves and to engage with a world that is also in flux– because to be an artist is to adapt. METAMORPHOSIS represents the changes we see within ourselves, within our work, and within the field of New Media as it continues to redefine itself.</p> <p>Alongside its students, New Media has also evolved through many stages – starting out in School of Image Arts, moving to RTA and culminating into its own standalone program. This moment marks the beginning of something new – a chance to celebrate how far we’ve come and envision where we’re headed. META as an ode to the past, MORPHOSIS as a nod to new beginnings.</p> <p>These works, ranging in form, process and approach are joined by the nature of the work at this time: one of artists in flux, one of a cultural moment, and one of a desire to share work publicly - and doing so, creating an exchange of thought, experience and insight. METAMORPHOSIS, a state of transition into something changed and distinct, is celebrated.</p>",
